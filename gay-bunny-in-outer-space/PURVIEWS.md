# Project Author Purviews

A color coding scheme is used in the Godot Editor to mark files as belonging to
a certain author, to quickly be able to know which author to contact for any
issues or features.

- Green: Ifynth
- Purple: Martin
- Red: Zoe

If any files belonging to an author other than yourself are modified, please add
a comment to revelant parts of the file/code denoting yourself as the author of
a particular code section.
